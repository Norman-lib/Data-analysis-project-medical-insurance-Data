The objective of this project is a simple application of what I recently learned in python and data analysis.
The program does a simple analysis of some insurance data I got from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets .
Before running the program, you should consider filling in the ROOT, PASSWORD, HOST and DATABASE variables in accordance with your local MySQL environment.
After filling those fields and making and running the program, it will do the following:
    - Analyse the data of the file Train_Data.csv by drawing some charts and logging some key statistics.
    - Generate a new file calles Train_Data_Processed.csv containing the same original data but with some key changes making the data more readable for a computer.
    - Create a MySQL database locally containing all the data inside the .csv file

The libriaries and concepts I applied in this project are:
    - Pandas
    - MySQL
    - Object-oriented programming in python (OOP)
    - Encapsulation in python
    and others...
